==========================
Import CODA Bank Statement
==========================

This module allows you to import your bank transactions with a standard
**CODA** file (you'll find samples in the 'data' folder).

This is an alternative to the official l10n_be_coda that uses the 
external python lib pycoda_ as parser.

Expected benefits:

* The pycoda parser is a better-tested external python lib.
* Better separation between file parsing and mapping of these data in Odoo.
* The module only depends of account_bank_statement_import.

Installation
============

To install this module, you need to install the python library pycoda_.
