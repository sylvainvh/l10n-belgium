to support Antibiotics Taxes.

Installation

module from the OCA/account-financial-tools repository .

* https://www.fagg-afmps.be/fr/veterinaire/medicaments/medicaments/distribution/taxe_antibiotique

You must make sure that the sequences of the ANTIOTIC taxes
is smaller than the sequences of the VAT taxes so the VAT is correctly
computed on top of the ANTIBIOTIC taxes. The sequences are correct
when using l10n_be_taxes.

The module also define a specific tax code template for antibiotic taxes which
may help in reporting, and specific expense and income account templates.
